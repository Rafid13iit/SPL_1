# Title : Graph Algorithm Implementation & Visualization

## Project Description: 

### Objective: 
The goal of this project is to implement and visualize a selection of graph algorithms using a  C, C++  language.

### Description: 
Graphs are used to represent relationships between data, and graph algorithms are used to analyze and manipulate these relationships. Some examples of common graph algorithms include breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), shortest path (Dijkstra’s or A*), and minimum spanning tree (Prim’s or Kruskal’s). In this project, I will choose a set of graph algorithms to implement and visualize.
To visualize the algorithms, I will create interactive visualizations that allow the user to see the steps of the algorithm as it progresses. This can be done using different graph libraries and functions.

### Deliverables: 
1. Code for implementing the selected graph algorithms
2. Interactive visualizations for each algorithm, showing the steps of the algorithm as it progresses
3. A report or presentation explaining the algorithms, the visualizations and any insights gained from the project

### Languages or Tools to be used:
C, C++, Visual Studio, Codeblocks, Git, Github
